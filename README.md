Did manage to make it mobile responsive, add interations and to make the code more semantic but had a bitter sweet finish with failing at making the mobile version fully accesible (hamburger menu&close icon are 1 that animate into each other and I had absolutely no idea where to even begin) and to make it more user friendly with being able to click outside the menu to close it).
Def learned a lot but need to keep grinding. Peace oat xx

FIRST LOG
Started my frontend journey about 6 weeks ago and tried to code it without looking up any tutorials or asking google for help.

Main goal was to make it responsive on desktop (mobile would be the next step) and to use css variables.

Code def went messy down the line but wanted to finish it as quickly as I could with the limited knowledge that I have. Was meant to add interactions and make it more accessible for screen readers but oh well, maybe next time.
